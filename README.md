MICS-4514_CO_and_NOx_Sensor_Breakout
==========================

Breakout board for the MiCS-4514 CO and NOx gas sensor.

Calculating CO and NOx Values
-----------------------------

I have not been able to work on this project in a few years, and at this point, I don't think I'll be able to continue the project in the foreseeable future (i.e. consider it a dead project). However, you are more than welcome to use the boards to make your own breakouts. If you are looking for example code on how to get CO and NOx readings, please [see this aricle](http://myscope.net/auswertung-der-airpi-gas-sensoren/) (in German, but the math should still work :).
